            <p>
                I was born and raised in Rwanda where I sent all my childhood. I am currently a student at   
                Algonquin College in the Interactive Media Design program and I live in Ottawa. I like to go 
                out and enjoy life with my family and friends. My favorite sport is football and I like to 
                swim.
            </p>

                Growing up, I have always wanted to travel abroad and change my environment and explore     
                other countries. Coming to study in Canada was a best option for me as I am learning new 
                leaving style and meeting with new people from different countries. Even though the 
                weather is not friendly during winter, I can still adapt easily.
