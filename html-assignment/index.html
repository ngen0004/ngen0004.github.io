            <p>
              I am <em><strong>Gilbert Ngendahimana</strong></em> and I was born and raised in 
              <strong>Rwanda</strong> where I spent all my childhood. Currently I live in Ottawa, and I am a 
              student at <em>Algonquin College</em> in the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> 
              program. I like to develop web applications and the idea came when I was in my 10<sup>th</sup> 
              grade. I like to go out and enjoy life with my family and friends.
            </p>
            <p>
              Growing up, I have always wanted to travel abroad and change my environment and explore     
              other countries. Coming to study in <strong>Canada</strong> was a best option for me as I am 
              learning new leaving style and meeting with new people from different countries. Even though 
              the weather is not friendly during winter, I can still adapt easily.
